# Customer Churn Analysis & Dashboard

## Project Goal
The goal of this project was to analyze a telecom dataset to understand the key drivers of customer churn. The final output is an interactive Tableau dashboard that summarizes the findings for business stakeholders.

## Key Findings
* The overall churn rate is approximately 26.5%.
* Customers on **month-to-month contracts** are the most likely to churn, with a rate of over 42%.
* New customers (0-12 months tenure) are at a high risk of churning (47% churn rate).
* Lack of key services like **Online Security** and **Tech Support** are strong indicators of churn. The most at-risk segment—month-to-month customers without online security—has a churn rate of over 51%.

## Tools Used
* **Excel:** Initial data exploration and discovery.
* **Python (Pandas):** Data cleaning and preparation.
* **SQL:** In-depth data analysis and segmentation.
* **Tableau:** Created the final interactive dashboard for visualization.
